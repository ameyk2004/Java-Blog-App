This repository is a step-by-step journey through building a secure and efficient RESTful API using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Security**. The project is designed to help me (and others) understand how to streamline API development, implement best practices, and apply robust security measures.

## Create a new Project

Generate your Spring Boot project via [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) with the following settings:

### Project Settings
- **Project:** Maven | **Language:** Java | **Java:** 21 | **Boot Version:** 3.4.0
- **Group:** `com.devtiro` | **Artifact/Name:** `blog`
- **Package:** `com.devtiro.blog` | **Packaging:** JAR
- **Description:** A blog platform

### Dependencies
Click **"Add Dependencies"** and select:
Got it! Here's the updated table with two dependencies per row:

| Dependency         | Purpose                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Spring Web         | REST API support                       |
| Spring Data JPA    | ORM & persistence                      |
| PostgreSQL Driver  | Connect to PostgreSQL database         |
| Spring Security    | Authentication & authorization         |
| Lombok             | Reduces boilerplate code               |
| Validation         | Enables bean validation                |
| H2                 | In-memory database for testing         |

## Project Overview

![Domain Model](readme_images/domain_model.png)

The `domain model diagram` helps us to see how the different enties in the project are related, what kind of attributes does each domain have and how are they going to communicate with each other.

![Class Model](readme_images/class_model_diagram.png)

The `class model diagram` has additional information like the relationships, datatypes of each attribute.

# Running the Database
We'll set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose, which will serve as the persistent
data store for our blog.

This containerized approach ensures consistency across development environments and simplifies
database management.

- create a new file named docker-compose.yml
